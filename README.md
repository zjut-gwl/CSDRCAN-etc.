The test code for our TIP paper "Deep-Learned Regularization and Proximal Operator for Image Compressive Sensing" will be released here. Please look forward to it.
You can contact me if you have any questions. My email is zanchen2@zjut.edu.cn
To run the code, you should copy the file "vl_simplenn" to your Matconvnet.
